    "description": "I am pretty happy so far with this device using Linux. All function keys work as expected. I have not set up a way to rotate the screen when used in tablet mode as I don't ever use it this way. It is a cute gimmick but I would have been fine with a traditional laptop hinge. The only bit of advice is that you will be wise to use an OEM kernel (for Ubuntu/mint) makes support for the display drivers and brightness function keys work properly. Beyond that, it was a painless install and I am pleased with the performance for a general-purpose laptop."

    "description": "Only had this unit for a couple weeks, but so far so good. Light, powerful, feature-packed EVO-certified. This model ( UX363EA-AS74T) includes an Intel Evo Platform Core i7-1165G7 CPU, Intel Iris Xe, 16GB RAM, and a 1TB SSD (M.2 NVMe™ PCIe® 3.0 Performance SSD). It has HDMI and USB Type-A ports and two Thunderbolt 4 USB-C ports with Power Delivery and DisplayPort support. Only thing missing is a finger print reader but face recognition is supported. Near the end of initial setup process was an option to upgrade to Windows 11 Pro which I accepted."

    "description": "I wanted a replacement for my laptop/tablet. I have been using a Lenovo miix 700, since 12/16! This thing is a beast. Not a powerhouse, by any means, but I carried it with me daily, and it runs everything I needed it to (office, internet browsing, music, etc.) Just recently, I noticed that the battery life is significantly shortened."

The tech specs were decent for the price, but the poor overall design prevents this from being useful to me at all. I expect this would fall apart in under a year if I didn't return it."

    "description": "I likee Asus as a brand they make excellent products , however this one just did not work out for me . The screen developed Ghost/phantom touching esentially moving and clicking the cursor all over the screen without user imput rendering it compleaty unusable. No amount of updates or resets would fix the issue. Asus offered to fix by having me send it in for repairs. Since it was only a week old and still covered by Amazons refund policy I ended up returning it and buying a ROG zephyrus duo instead . Aside from the display issue the device also gets hot fast . Prehaps it was just me being unlucky but I did not have enough confidence to replace it for the same mode"

    "description": "I purchased the computer with 1 tb SSD and 16 gb ram a month ago. I think the performance is good, and the picture is good. I am mostly happy with the computer. The battery life is very good. I don't really like the keyboard very much, and I don't think it is very comfortable to type on. The touchscreen attracts a lot of fingerprints, so the screen requires frequent cleaning. I am submitting the review so that asus will give me a warranty extension."
